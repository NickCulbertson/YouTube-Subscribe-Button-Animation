## About YouTube Subscribe Button Animation

This project was born out of necessity. I was going through various free green screen subscribe templates and all the downloads were low quality videos or from untrusted sites. So, I made my own template in Screenflow that I use and am sharing with you. I'm making this template Open Source because I want to empower creatives to support themselves. You've worked too hard, too long to give away control. I hope it helps make your first impression for your followers most triumphant! 

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback please send them my way. This is as much for me as it is for you. If you use it, send me a link! I'd love to see your work. 

Enjoy!
